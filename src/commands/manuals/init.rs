    init - initialize a project from an existing directory

SYNOPSIS
    orbit init [options] [<path>]

DESCRIPTION
    Initializes a project at the file system directory '<path>'. If no path is
    provided, then it defaults to the current working directory. 
    
    If no name is provided, then the resulting project's name defaults to the 
    directory's name. Using the '--name' option allows the project's name to be 
    explicitly set.
    
    Under certain circumstances, you may need a new uuid. This situation will be
    uncommon for many users, but nonetheless it exists. To display a new uuid that
    can be copied into an existing manifest, use the '--uuid' option. All other
    options are ignored when this option is present. Keep in mind that a project's 
    uuid is not intended to change over the course of its lifetime.
    
    The newly created manifest file is intended to be edited by the user. See more
    'Orbit.toml' keys and their definitions at:
    
       https://chaseruskin.github.io/orbit/reference/manifest.html
    
    To create a new project from a non-existing directory, see the 'new' command.
