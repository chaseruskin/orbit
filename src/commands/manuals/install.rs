    install - store an immutable reference to an ip

SYNOPSIS
    orbit install [options]

DESCRIPTION
    This command will place an ip into the cache. By default, the specified version
    is the 'latest' released version orbit can identify.
    
    When this command is ran without specifying the <ip> or a source (such as
    '--url' or '--path'), it will attempt to install the current working ip, if it
    exists.
    
    By default, any dependencies required only for development by the target ip are
    omitted from installation. To also install these dependencies, use '--all'.
    
    If a protocol is recognized using '--protocol', then an optional tag can also 
    be supplied to help the protocol with providing any additional information it
    may require.

OPTIONS
    <ip>
        Ip specification

    --url <url>
        URL to install the ip from the internet

    --path <path>
        Path to install the ip from local file system

    --protocol <name>
        Use a configured protocol to download ip

    --tag <tag>
        Unique tag to provide to the protocol

    --force
        Install the ip regardless of the cache slot occupancy

    --list
        View available protocols and exit

    --all
        Install all dependencies (including development)

EXAMPLES
    orbit install
    orbit install lcd_driver:2.0
    orbit install adder:1.0.0 --url https://my.adder/project.zip
    orbit install alu:2.3.7 --path ./projects/alu --force
