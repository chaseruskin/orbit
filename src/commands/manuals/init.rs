    init - initialize an ip from an existing project

SYNOPSIS
    orbit init [options] [<path>]

DESCRIPTION
    Initializes an ip at the file system directory '<path>'. If not path is
    provided, then it defaults to the current working directory. 
    
    If no name is provided, then the resulting ip's name defaults to the 
    directory's name. Using the '--name' option allows the ip's name to be 
    explicitly set.
    
    Under certain circumstances, you may need a new uuid. This situation will be
    uncommon for many users, but nonetheless it exists. To display a new uuid that
    can be copied into an existing manifest, use the '--uuid' option. All other
    options are ignored when this option is present. Keep in mind that an ip's uuid
    is not intended to change over the course of its lifetime.
    
    To create a new ip from a non-existing directory, see the 'new' command.

OPTIONS
    <path>
        Directory to initialize

    --name <name>
        Set the resulting ip's name

    --lib <lib>
        Set the resulting ip's library

    --uuid
        Print a new uuid and exit

EXAMPLES
    orbit init
    orbit init projects/gates
    orbit init --name adder
    orbit init --uuid
