description = """
This command carries out the "planning phase". This phase involves reading

their defined fileset into a blueprint file for future build processes. This 
command acts upon the current working ip.

By default, the top level unit and testbench are auto-detected according to
the current design heirarchy. If there are multiple candidates for a potential
top level or testbench, it will exit and ask the user to explicitly select
a candidate. To include all top levels and testbenches, use `-all`.

The top level unit and testbench will be stored in a `.env` file within the
build directory. This `.env` file is read during the build command to set
the proper environment variables for downstream plugins and scripts that
may require this information. If a known plugin is provided with `--plugin`,
then it will also be stored in the `.env` file to be recalled during the
build phase.

User-defined filesets are only collected within the current working ip's 
path. Plugins may have custom filesets defined in their configuration. When
specifying a known plugin with `--plugin`, it will collect the filesets 
defined for that plugin. Use `--fileset` as many times as needed to define
additional filesets.

During the planning phase, a lockfile is produced outlining the exact ip
dependencies required, how to get them, and how to verify them. The lockfile
should be checked into version control and should not manually edited by the 
user.

If the current working ip's manifest data matches its data stored in its
own lockfile, then Orbit will read from the lockfile to create the ip
dependency graph. To force Orbit to build the ip dependency graph from
scratch, use `--force`.
  
If only needing to update the lockfile, use `--lock-only`. This flag does 
not require a toplevel or testbench to be determined. Using `--lock-only` with
`--force` will overwrite the lockfile regardless if it is already in sync 
with the current working ip's manifest data.

When updating the lockfile, this command will download and install any new
dependencies if necessary. To only download an ip, see the `download` command.
To only install an ip, see the `install` command.

If an installed dependency's computed checksum does not match the checksum
stored in the lockfile, it assumes the installation to be corrupt and will 
re-install the dependency to the cache.

Downloads are vital to Orbit's management system as to avoid having to solely

repair broken installations and allow users to learn about IP before installing.

When using a custom protocol, Orbit expects the final fetched repository to
exist within a special directory called the queue. By default, the queue is set
to a temporary directory, but it can be overridden with `--queue`. After a 
protocol is executed, Orbit resumes the download process by trying to detect the 
target IP and then performing a compression algorithm on the path to store as a 
single file archive. This final archive is special and packed with additional 
bytes, which makes it unsuitable to easily unzip with existing compression 
tools.

A lockfile is required to exist in the current IP in order to download its 
dependencies.

Variable substitution is supported when specifying the "command" and "args"
fields for a protocol. Most notably, the queue is accessed as
