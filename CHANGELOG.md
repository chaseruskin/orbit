- resolves bug when installing a local ip without a lockfile would place it into archive but refuse to load it for future use due to erroneous state
  
## 0.17.0

### Features
- implements first attempt at the full process for publishing an ip to a channel
- adds `ORBIT_IP_INDEX` environment variable during publish process for channels to use in custom processes
- supports basic publish action where the manifest gets copied to the channel's index path

- renames `orbit launch` to `orbit publish` in favor of clearer intentions behind the command

### Fixes

## 0.16.0

### Features
- grants ability to omit the ip name during `orbit install` when using `--url` if there is only 1 ip that exists at that url
- adds support for specifying a relative path to an ip as dependency
- adds support for systemverilog `interface` design elements as well as detecting references to them in module port declarations
- systemverilog code can now be read using `orbit read` command

### Changes
- ip names can no longer end with a dash or underscore

- adds hints and clearer error messages around build process (`orbit build`, `orbit test`) and tree viewing (`orbit tree`)
- adds proper error message when a source file does not contain valid UTF-8 data instead of panicking
- properly detects module instances that use the range specificer in verilog and systemverilog files

## 0.14.0

This update brings a more streamlined command sequence/development process, better error messages, and the first initial support for Verilog!

### Features
- initial verilog support includes: module declarations, instantiations, wire declarations, recognition within VHDL files, DST, reading verilog files using `orbit read`, setting them as top level units or testbenches for the build process

- no longer allows `orbit build` to specify a testbench, see `orbit test`
- fixes configuration precedence
- renames "plugin" to "target" to more closely align with software language terminology relating to back end processes
