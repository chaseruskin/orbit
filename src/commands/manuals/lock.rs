    lock - save the world state of an ip

SYNOPSIS
    orbit lock [options]

DESCRIPTION
    This command saves the state of the world according to the working ip. To
    accomplish this, Orbit reads working ip's manifest file to resolve any
    missing dependencies. It's writes all the information that is necessary to
    reproduce this state to the ip's lock file, Orbit.lock.
    
    This command can only be ran within a working ip.
    
    It is encouraged to check the lock file into version control such that others
    trying to build the ip can reproduce the ip's current state. The lock file
    should not be manually edited by the user.
    
    To capture the state of the world according to the ip, this command will
    download and install any unresolved dependencies. If an installed dependency's 
    computed checksum does not match the checksum stored in the lock file, it 
    assumes the installation to be corrupt and will re-install the dependency to 
    the cache.

OPTIONS
    --force
        Ignore reading the precomputed lock file

EXAMPLES
    orbit lock
    orbit lock --force
