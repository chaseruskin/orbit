:: GETTING STARTED WITH ORBIT                               ::

Orbit is a package manager and build system for hardware
description languages. It is a single binary executable
interfaced through the command-line.

:: AUTOMATIC INSTALLATION  ::
-----------------------------

Run the provided `install` executable. It will guide you 
through the necessary configurations and ask a final prompt 
if the user wishes to proceed with the installation.

NOTE: If the requested installation path requires elevated 
    privileges, then the install executable must be ran 
    with those privileges.

NOTE: For unix, only the Orbit binary is installed. For
    windows, the entire Orbit directory is installed.
