    remove - delete an ip from the catalog

SYNOPSIS
    orbit remove [options] <ip>

DESCRIPTION
    Deletes save data for a known ip from the catalog. The ip's data for its
    particular version is removed from the catalog's cache and the catalog's
    archive.
    
    By default, an interactive prompt will appear to confirm with the user if the 
    correct ip is okay to be removed. To skip this interactive prompt and assume
    it is correct without confirmation, use the '--force' option.
    
    To add ip to the catalog, see the 'install' command.

OPTIONS
    <ip>
        Ip specification

    --recurse, -r
        Also remove the ip's dependencies

    --force
        Skip interactive prompts

    --verbose
        Display where the removal occurs

EXAMPLES
    orbit remove gates
    orbit remove gates:1.0.1 --force
