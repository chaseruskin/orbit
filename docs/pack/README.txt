1. Run the `install` executable. It will guide you through
    the necessary configurations and ask a final prompt if
    the user wishes to proceed with the installation.

NOTE: If the requested installation path requires elevated 
    privileges, then the install executable must be ran with
    those privileges.

NOTE: For unix, only the orbit binary is installed. For
    windows, the entire orbit directory is installed.
