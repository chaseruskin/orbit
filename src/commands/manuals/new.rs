    new - create a new project

SYNOPSIS
    orbit new [options] <path>

DESCRIPTION
    Creates a new project at the target directory '<path>'. The path is assumed to 
    not already exist. A new directory will be created at the file system 
    destination that contains a minimal manifest file.
    
    If no name is supplied, then the project's name defaults to the final directory 
    name taken from '<path>'. Using the '--name' option allows this field to be
    explicitly set.
    
    The newly created manifest file is intended to be edited by the user. See more
    'Orbit.toml' keys and their definitions at:
    
       https://chaseruskin.github.io/orbit/reference/manifest.html
    
    For initializing an already existing directory into a project, see the 'init' 
    command.
