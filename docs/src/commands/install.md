# __orbit install__

## __NAME__

install - store an immutable reference to an ip

## __SYNOPSIS__

```
orbit install [options]
```

## __DESCRIPTION__

This command will place an ip into the cache. By default, the specified version
is the 'latest' released version orbit can identify.

When this command is ran without specifying the <ip> or a source (such as
`--url` or `--path`), it will attempt to install the current working ip, if it
exists.

By default, any dependencies required only for development by the target ip are
omitted from installation. To also install these dependencies, use the 
`--all-deps` flag.

If a protocol is recognized using `--protocol`, then an optional tag can also 
be supplied to help the protocol with providing any additional information it
may require.

The `--path` option can accept a file system path that is either 1) the root 
directory that contains the manifest file or 2) a zip archive file that when 
uncompressed, has the manifest file at the root directoy.

The `--all-public` flag can be used to skip providing the "ip.public" field
in the current ip's manifest, granting the assumption that all source files
should be public. It can only be present when installing from a local ip and
when the "ip.public" field does not exist.

To remove ip from the catalog, see the `remove` command.
